Had to watch the video because I didn't want to make a wechat account and its locked under premium on leetcode. The premise is pretty simple but it takes a while to implement. Basically have a number identifer and a symbol to indicate when to start the decoding process.

## Encode and Decode
When encoding, we want to append the length of the word in the beginning to tell us how long the word is in the decoding process. However, there may be other numbers within our string, so right beside our number, we add a "#" symbol to indicate that before the pound is a number and after it is a string. From there, we can get an answer.
