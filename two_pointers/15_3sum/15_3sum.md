# 15 - 3Sum

**Time Elapsed**: 1 hr 25 min
**Difficulty**: medium
**Thoughts**: This was a hard question. I definitely need to revisit this.

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Explanation: 
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,1]
Output: []
Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [0,0,0]
Output: [[0,0,0]]
Explanation: The only possible triplet sums up to 0.

 

Constraints:

    3 <= nums.length <= 3000
    -105 <= nums[i] <= 105

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
My first thoughts when completing this question was the brute force method in which I would do a triple for loop to get our answer.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
We first have to sort these numbers and then use pointers to get our sum. If we think about the two sum question, this is basically the same thing, but our target number is the current number in the loop in which we have to get the sum of two other numbers other than it. If that sum equals 0, then we have a triple. The hard part about this question was the duplicates!

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(n^2)$


- Space complexity: $O(n)$

# Code
```python
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: list[int]) -> list[list[int]]:
        nums = sorted(nums)

        triples = []
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            current_num = nums[i]

            if i > 0 and nums[i - 1] == current_num:
                continue

            left, right = i + 1, len(nums) - 1
            while left < right:

                sum = current_num + nums[left] + nums[right]

                if sum < 0:
                    left += 1
                elif sum > 0:
                    right -= 1
                else:
                    triple = [current_num, nums[left], nums[right]]
                    triples.append(triple)
                    left += 1
                    try:
                        while nums[left] == nums[left - 1]:
                            left += 1
                    except:
                        continue


        return triples


```
